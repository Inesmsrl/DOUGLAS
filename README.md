The agri-food sector, especially livestock, contributes to a substantial share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In parallel, diet represents one of the main risk factors of all-cause mortality in Europe, mainly linked to diets that are too high in animal foods and too low in plant-based foods. The implementation of climate policies aiming at reducing agri-foodâ€™s GHG emissions could therefore bring important health co-benefits. Within this context, the PHILoCTET-Food project evaluates the health co-benefits of diet shifts in the French population following trajectories toward net-zero emission by 2050. 

The French Agency for Ecological Transition (ADEME) has designed 4 prospective Transition(s)2050 scenarios achieving net-zero GHG emission by 2050 for metropolitan France, involving highly contrasting economic, technological and societal changes, notably in the agri-food sector. : https://www.ademe.fr/les-futurs-en-transition/. In 2022, the transformations of the French food system and especially the food consumptions evolutions within each of these scenarios were published by the SISAE working group, notably led by the INRAE and
Solagro, coordinated by the CIRED and based on the findings of a project coordinated by Carine Barbier : https://librairie.ademe.fr/consommer-autrement/5601-simulation-prospective-du-systeme-alimentaire-et-de-son-empreinte-carbone-sisae.html#:~:text=Le%20projet%20SISAE%20%C3%A9value%20l,syst%C3%A8mes%20de%20production%20agricoles%2C%203.

This study aims to estimate the health co-benefits on all-cause mortality of shifts in dietary patterns in the French adult population, in order to contribute to the net-zero carbon transition by 2050 in the agri-food sector. The DOUGLAS (Diets Optimizing Universal Goals for Lifelong Achievement of Sustainable health) model was built as a prospective HIA model, following the most recent guidelines for modeling and reporting health effects of climate change mitigation actions. The model takes three main types of input data:
- demographic projections,
- dietary evolution scenarios,
- dose-response relationships linking the intake of the considered food categories and mortality.
